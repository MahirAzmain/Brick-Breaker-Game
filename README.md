## BrickBreaker Game

Java Game Programming for Desktop
<br>
I developed a brick-breaker game using Java. I use a JFrame and a JPanel to draw different graphics, making this game work perfectly.
A classic arcade-style Brick Breaker game developed in Java as a 2nd-year university project. This game offers smooth gameplay and responsive controls, 
challenging players to break all bricks using a bouncing ball and a paddle.

‚ú® Features
Classic Gameplay: Experience the timeless fun of breaking bricks to clear levels.

Keyboard Controls: Intuitive paddle movement using the arrow keys for precise control.

Score Tracking: Keep an eye on your progress with real-time score display.

Game Over & Victory Logic: Clear all bricks to win, or lose lives if you miss the ball, adding a layer of challenge.

Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes, each featuring unique brick layouts and challenges.

User Authentication: Secure login and registration system to manage player accounts.

Leaderboard: Compete with others and see who can achieve the highest scores.

Help Section: Access in-game instructions and tips to get started.

## BrickBreaker Game

# Java Game Programming for Desktop
<br>

I developed a brick-breaker game using Java. I use a JFrame and a JPanel to draw different graphics, making this game work perfectly.
A classic arcade-style Brick Breaker game developed in Java as a 2nd-year university project. This game offers smooth gameplay and responsive controls, 
challenging players to break all bricks using a bouncing ball and a paddle.

## ‚ú® Features
# Classic Gameplay: Experience the timeless fun of breaking bricks to clear levels.

# Keyboard Controls: Intuitive paddle movement using the arrow keys for precise control.

# Score Tracking: Keep an eye on your progress with real-time score display.

# Game Over & Victory Logic: Clear all bricks to win, or lose lives if you miss the ball, adding a layer of challenge.

# Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes, each featuring unique brick layouts and challenges.

# User Authentication: Secure login and registration system to manage player accounts.

# Leaderboard: Compete with others and see who can achieve the highest scores.

# Help Section: Access in-game instructions and tips to get started.

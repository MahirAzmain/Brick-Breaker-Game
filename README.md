# Java Game Programming for Desktop

I developed a brick-breaker game using Java. I use a JFrame and a JPanel to draw different graphics, making this game work perfectly.
A classic arcade-style Brick Breaker game developed in Java as a 2nd-year university project. This game offers smooth gameplay and responsive controls, 
challenging players to break all bricks using a bouncing ball and a paddle.

## ✨ Features
